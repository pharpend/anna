<p>My family bought Anna as a baby puppy to serve as a family hunting
  retriever.  She has lived up to her promise, and more.  She loves
  the birds and is very serious about retrieving, but she knows how to
  turn it off in the house.  She is quiet, clean and well-mannered as
  well as athletic, fast and stylish.</p>

<p>Anna comes from a long line of outstanding gun dogs with a strong
  field pedigree.  Despite being handicapped by her novice trainer (me),
  Anna has earned the AKC Master Hunter title, finished
  several Derbies including placing first and second, and 
  accrued a few all age points including an Amateur win towards the
  AFC and FC titles. She is an excellent marking dog and very
  biddable. </p>

 <p>Anna has not gotten to hunt as much as she deserves.  However,
 after just a few outings in the duck blind she learned to watch the sky
 for birds and ready herself for the retrieve before the shots are
 fired.  At the game preserve, she flushes more birds than we pay for
 (she has an outstanding nose), and she has tracked and retrieved our
 poorly shot pheasants that go down several hundred yards away.</p>

<p>On her days off, Anna makes herself at home on the sofa or plays baseball with the boys in the back yard.  
</p>
  
 <p> Anna&rsquo;s sire is Seaside's Casey Jones MH (littermate to CFC CAFC Gold Star
  Take&rsquo;M Tex MH); Casey is the progeny of NFC FC AFC
  Dewey&rsquo;s Drake of Moon Rivers and a Lean Mac daughter.</p>

  <p>Anna&rsquo;s dam, Leitner Farms Challenger SH, was sired by FC
  AFC Hunting Hills Coriander.  </p>
